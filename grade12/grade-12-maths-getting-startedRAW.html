<p>There is no denying it - getting started in Grade 12 Maths is Daunting.</p>
<p>Never fear a situation where you don't know what is going on - that means you are probably in the right place. If however you are still lost after a few minutes back up one and repeat.</p>

<p><strong>The Good News</strong></p>
<p>There is no such thing as a Candidate that cannot get an A for Maths.</p>
<p>It is the <strong>Brutal and Barbaric Classroom System</strong> that fails, the students just bear the brunt of that failure.</p>
<p>You may have spent your whole life believing that you are bad at Maths - Shame on the people that taught you.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad News</strong></p>
<p>We don't care how weak you are when you start. However the weaker you are, the more you have to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bad news is that we treasure our <strong>100% Distinction Pass Rate.</strong> We can get you there too, but it takes effort. If you don't put in the required effort for your level, we let you go back to the hole that you crawled out of and the rest of your days will be filled with darkness.</p>

<p><strong>The Learning Tree</strong></p>
<p>First understand that the boundaries of Grade 10,11,12 etc are artificial. These boundaries are set by national Governments who have to shove hundreds of thousands through their school systems. <strong>These rules do not apply to the 1%.</strong> We don't stop at these school boundaries. Eventually everyone that is successful at Maths, Science and Business has to get at least the First Year College syllabus done. The sooner you get it all done the better. We encourage you to take AP Maths, Additional Maths and A- Level Maths. The more you learn advanced topics, the easier the regular stuff becomes.</p>
<p>We break the Grade 12 Syllabus down into 17 Sections and 75 Lectures.</p>
<p>We put these lectures into a Learning Tree and do them on the optimal order. We don't waste time learning questions we already know and we don't waste time struggling on Questions that are out of order for the Tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each Lecture there are usually less than 5 "Askable" questions. This works out to 300 "askable" questions. Whether you are IEB, NSC GCSE A Levels K12 - it is just variations on these questions. Learn to recoginse the question for what it is and you simply substitute the answer.</p>
<p>The more you practice these questions, the faster you can recognize them and the faster you can substitute the answers.</p>
<p>Every question must be answered. <strong>Do not move on from a question unless you can answer it</strong>. At worst, mark it and&nbsp; always come back.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="col-sm-8">
<p><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong></p>
<p>What do we mean by Pattern Recognitions Vs Analytical Solving.</p>
<p>You have learned for the last 12 years that you have to develop your mind to take on new Mathematical problems. Yeah maybe. What we do here is show you how a machine would learn Maths. We call this Deep Learning. Learn to recognise the 300 questions - doing them becomes easy - and around you they will start popping up in life. They are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are absolutely convinced that you can't do Maths and you just want to run, first to Maths Lit and then to the safety of the brain-dead world, spend some time on these <a href="http://www.nicologic.fr/pattern.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pattern Recognition</a> tests.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
<p>For most of the last 40 years I have believed in analytical Methods.</p>
<p>From building 150 Non LInear Equation models of the Economy (1982) to the First English to Afrikaans Translator (1992), a TurboCASH Transaction processor that manages $4BN in transactions (2011) using SQL - I have&nbsp; always chosen analytical methods for the preferred solution.</p>
<p>I was wrong!</p>
<p>Over the last few years using little mote than trumped up linear comparisons, Deep Learning and AI has started to win on all fronts. Machines make better stock market predictions, translations are better with brute force, NOSQL databases contain Terrabytes of Info. <strong>It is a hard pill to swallow.</strong> Mindless repeating machines beat the best brains humans have to offer. They can even drive cars better than us!</p>
<p>Why not steal from the obvious?</p>
<p>High School Maths has been sold to us as the cutting edge decider between the dumb and the talented - a God given gift for analytical thinking! Students are "streamed" from Grade 10 with those with weaker analytical abilities sidelined to the scrap heap of mathematical obscurity.</p>
<p>What is if this is not true? What if High school maths is just a simple list of repeatable questions? This makes getting an A for Maths just like passing your drivers test by recognising road signs.</p>
